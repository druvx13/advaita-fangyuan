                            In Advaita Vedānta, the bondage of <span class="italic">saṃsāra</span> is rooted in <span class="sanskrit">kāmāḥ</span> – the desires and attachments that arise from ignorance (<span class="sanskrit">avidyā</span>) of one's true Self.

                        <p>
                            This verse encapsulates the Advaita teaching that only by renouncing <span class="italic">kāma</span> can the <span class="italic">jīva</span> (individual soul) realize its identity with Brahman, the universal Self.

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            In Bhagavad Gītā, Krishna warns that <span class="sanskrit">"kāmaḥ eṣa krodha eṣa"</span> – lust is born of contact with passion, and when thwarted becomes wrath... Know this to be the all-devouring enemy (<span class="sanskrit">vairiṇa</span>) of the wise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In Vedantic metaphysics, <span class="italic">kāma</span> (often including <span class="italic">krodha</span> – anger and <span class="italic">lobha</span> – greed) fuels the cycle of births.

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-emerald-300 mb-4">The Path to Liberation</h3>
                        <p class="mb-4">
                            As Katha Upaniṣad 2.1.2 explains, "as long as [he] cherishes desires ... he goes through the round of births and deaths. But when he realizes himself to be infinite Ātman ... he then becomes free from ignorance, desire, and action, and is emancipated from death".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus Vedānta holds that <span class="italic">ahamkāra</span> (ego) and its <span class="italic">vasanas</span> (mental residues) are superimpositions upon the Self; by <span class="italic">jñāna</span> (self-knowledge) one dispels these illusions.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p class="mb-4">
                            The śāstras declare <span class="italic">ātman</span> as <span class="sanskrit">sat-cit-ānanda</span> (existence-consciousness-bliss) and identical to Brahman (<span class="sanskrit">mahāvākya aham brahmāsmi</span>).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this state of realization the false dichotomy of "mortal–immortal" vanishes: the liberated being experiences <span class="italic">amata</span> (deathlessness) here and now, even while living (<span class="italic">jīvanmukta</span>).

                        <p>Desire (<span class="italic">kāma</span>) is repeatedly called "all-devouring" and the root of bondage. Advaita sees all action born of desire as tainted by <span class="italic">rajas</span> and <span class="italic">tamas</span> (ignorance).</p>

                        <p>Advaita asserts an absolute non-duality (<span class="italic">advaita</span>): the apparent multiplicity is <span class="italic">mithyā</span> (neither true nor false reality). The "dropping of egoic identity" is the pivot.</p>

                        <p>Mokṣa in Vedānta literally means release or immortality (<span class="italic">amṛta</span>). The "mortal" refers to the limited ego-self; the "immortal" is the Self (<span class="italic">ātman</span>) understood as Brahman.</p>

                            Unlike a sectarian cultivator, Fang Yuan feels no filial piety or friendship binding him. He has abandoned Confucian/moral constraints; in one confrontation he sneers:

                            On the surface, Fang Yuan behaves with cold detachment: he considers emotions "boring". Yet Fang's detachment is not spiritual; it is a pragmatic armor.

                            He often speaks of defying cosmic order: "Defy heaven, defy fate, defy the universe!" His maxim is survival by the fittest: <span class="italic">"I am here for my own interests... If an immortal blocks me, I will slay the immortal."</span>

                        <p>The world is essentially Darwinian. Cultivators seek immortality through personal effort (every opportunistic cheat is fair). Reincarnation is concrete: Fang resets his life using the Spring Autumn Cicada Gu.</p>

                        <p>Fang Yuan's metaphysics is the flip side of destiny: he denies any moral meaning in suffering and uses karma as a resource rather than a restraint. He destroys "calamity Gu" to escape Heaven's interference.</p>

                        <p>His pursuit of "eternal detachment" is not Advaitic renunciation but a will-to-power and rebellion: he embraces only his desire for immortality and the freedom to pursue it beyond all bounds.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">
                    At first glance Fang Yuan's disregard for love and hatred mirrors the Vedāntic ideal of <span class="sanskrit">virāga</span>. Like the sage who "does not covet any uncertain thing", Fang has renounced worldly attachments. His emotional state is eerily calm; he has "no ripples" on his soul.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    However, key differences emerge: Advaita's dispassion is rooted in realization of the Self, whereas Fang's is tactical boredom. He is "tired" of lower desires, yet this exhaustion simply refocuses him on a new desire – absolute immortality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Advaita, once <span class="italic">ātman</span> is known, desires naturally dissolve; but Fang still desires (<span class="sanskrit">चाह</span>), albeit a loftier object. His desire is no longer for sensual pleasure, but for the impossible (<span class="italic">amatum</span>). Vedanta would say this is merely subtle <span class="italic">kāma</span>, anvasana of ego: he still identifies as Fang Yuan, still clings to "I".
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-8">

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">Morality and Karma</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Vedantic philosophy emphasizes <span class="italic">nitya-dharma</span> (eternal righteousness) and compassion as outgrowths of Self-knowledge. Self-realized sages naturally love all beings as themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Fang Yuan, by contrast, outright rejects any moral law. Where Arjuna is called to transcend selfish desire (BG 3.43), Fang declares "love and friendship ... boring". He enjoys suffering inflicted on others ("fabulous that they died").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He mocks the notion of "sin" as only a tool of the weak. His ethos is adamantine egotism: he expects neither divine nor karmic retribution on moral grounds, only strategic setbacks.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">Freedom vs. Surrender</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The Upanishadic ideal of <span class="italic">mokṣa</span> is freedom through surrender to Brahman, ultimately seeing no agent but the Self. Fang Yuan's "freedom" is through conquering – dominion over Heaven's Will and the world.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        He "defies fate" rather than dissolving in it. From a Vedantic viewpoint, Fang has not attained the requisite <span class="italic">avidya-nivritti</span> (removal of ignorance); instead, he intensifies his ego-will.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His statements attempt a Spinozistic turn, but always with Fang at the center. He seems to echo Krishnamurti or Daoist self-cultivation platitudes, but does not actually transcend self-concern.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">Do All Desires Fall Away?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The crux: Upaniṣadic renunciation demands <span class="sanskrit">sarva-kāmāḥ</span> (all desires) fall away. Fang does cast off ordinary <span class="italic">kama</span> and even <span class="italic">krodha</span>, but his will to <span class="sanskrit">suṣūpṇa-āyuḥ</span> (everlasting life) remains.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    One could argue that in his mind the desire for mortality is merely replaced by desire for immortality – hardly <span class="sanskrit">pramucyante sarve kāmāḥ</span>. He even admits life's meaning came from the process of pursuing immortality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus he has not truly let go of desire; he has simply "upgraded" it. In Upanishadic terms, Fang is not a <span class="italic">jīvanmukta</span>: he still plays the roles of this world (as hero, demon, rebel) and has not realized the <span class="italic">sat</span> (truth) that "all is one".
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-300 mb-4">Immortality: Brahman or Simulacrum?</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Advaita promises <span class="sanskrit">amṛtatva</span> (deathlessness) through union with Brahman. This is not ordinary life extension but a metaphysical transformation of identity. In contrast, Fang Yuan literally seeks physical or Gu-given immortality.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    He attains the 11th-rank Demon Venerable stage. Yet this immortality remains in duality: Fang remains "Fang Yuan" with desires (though few). His soul carouses across lives, never at peace.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Vedanta distinguishes <span class="italic">amṛta</span> as the essence of <span class="italic">ātman</span> (inner void bliss) from <span class="italic">amṛtatva</span> as mere longevity. Fang's immortality is more akin to what the Heavens term <span class="chinese">"修炼到天人合一"</span> – a power-state — but he has not attained <span class="italic">nirguṇa-paramārtha</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Upaniṣads, true immortality is in <span class="italic">ānanda</span> (bliss) and equanimity, not in endless action. Fang's every step is still within <span class="italic">saṃsāra</span> (rebirth). Thus we must ask: is Fang's "immortality" an alignment with Brahman or a simulacrum?

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Fang Yuan and Reverend Insanity serve as a dark counterpoint to Advaita Vedānta. Fang's arc suggests that mere detachment or cynicism without surrendering the ego is not true liberation.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    If all desires truly fall away (as the Upaniṣad claims), one attains Brahman – an undying witness far beyond worldly schemes. Fang attains something else: a synthetic immortality of his own devising, admired by none but an eternal game-player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Upanishadic wisdom thus remains both illuminated and interrogated by his tale: it is not enough to denounce kāma in principle – one must annihilate the substratum of separateness from which all kāma springs.
